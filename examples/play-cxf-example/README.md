Play! framework module for Apache CXF - Client sample
=====================================================

Using Apache CXF in a Play! Framework project as both SOAP server and client.
* The SOAP service is available at http://localhost:9000/service/hello
* A SOAP client is used for generating the output of http://localhost:9000/sunrise-london

The Java classes for accessing the GlobalWeather service were generated by the command below, run from the `samples/play-cxf-client/app` directory.

    wsdl2java -p services.sunsetrise -client "http://www.webservicex.net/sunsetriseservice.asmx?WSDL"

More info about developing a SOAP client using Apache CXF is available [in its documentation](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-consumer.html).
